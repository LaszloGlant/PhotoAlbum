We both spent approximately the same amount of hours on the project, 50-50. We have both the about same amount of commits in bitbucket and we 

were both almost always present during the time of each commit. We stayed after each Tuesday and Thursday after the lecture until 11 or so and we

both worked together at the same time. On days besides Tuesday and Thursday, we called each other up frequently and used Webex (so that we could both

see the same screen), which made it easier for us to discuss ideas and convey our thoughts even when we were not together. We also updated each other

frequently and sent about 100 text messages each day so that the other person knows what his partner is doing and so knows not to modify the same file

or do the same task, which would waste time. We both contributed to each and every file, so none of the files are heavily contributed to by one person

and not the other person.
